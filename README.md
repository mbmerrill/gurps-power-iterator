# gurps-power-iterator
A calculator for GURPS Powers that includes the ability to iterate over many modifier choices to see different permutations of the power you're creating.

# Context

Steve Jackson Games produced <a href="http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/powers/">GURPS Powers</a>, which provided a detailed system for creating your own abilities for GURPS by taking existing advantages and applying enhancements and limitations.

# What Does This Tool Do?

There are lots of enhancements and limitations, and with the math involved, it's not always obvious what effect changing your enhancement and limitation selections will have on the final cost of your power.  Additionally, it's occasionally useful to see different "versions" of your power as you're tinkering with it - especially if you're building a "tiered" power (one with differing effectiveness for differing cost).

This tool allows you to pick a range of options for each enhancement or limitation; the tool will iterate over all permutations, producing a cost for each.  It also produces copy-and-paste-ready output in standard GURPS Powers format, ready to be included in your own work.
